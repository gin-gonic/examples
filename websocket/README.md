# Gin websocket Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.

The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:

```bash
$ go run server.go
```

Next, start the client:
```bash
$ go run client.go
```
The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
