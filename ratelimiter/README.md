# Ratelimit in Gin

This project is a sample for ratelimit using Leaky Bucket. Although the golang official pkg provide a implement with Token Bucket [time/rate](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/time/rate?tab=doc),

you can also make your owns via gin's functional `Use()` to integrate extra middlewares.

## Effect

```go
// You can assign the ratelimit of the server
// rps: requests per second
go run rate.go -rps=100
```

- Let's hava a simple test by ab with 3000 mock requests, not surprisinglyï¼Œit will takes 10ms each request.

```bash
ab -n 3000 -c 1 http://localhost:8080/rate
```
