# Use OTEL in Gin

Currently set `ContextWithFallback = true` to use otel in Gin, but this doesn't seem like a good solution.

This example shows a minimum case to use otel in Gin.

To run the example:

```bash
go run main.go
```

In stander output like this:

```bash
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:   export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:  gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)
